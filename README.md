***Home Screen***

Homescreen is a constant work in progress. The purpose of the homescreen is ease of access. All important required documents and information should be easily accessible within a matter of seconds to avoid longer wait times during immigration.

***Passport Management***

We understand every planet like to feel they are important and thus making visitors forcefully apply for passports. And they can add up real quick. Worry not! Manage all your passports through one single app - ours. Mars is the best planet.

***Adding a Passport***

We only require the necessary details to add a passport. Nothing crazy.

***Instant Messaging***

Users can get cat fished by other Martians or basically anyone in the universe in real time using our instant messaging service. Using Firebase functions, our instant messaging is indeed real time. Users will receive a real time notification every time user receives a new message if the app is not in focus. Ability to reply directly from the notification will be arriving shortly.

***Add Contacts***

Find and befriend other Martians. Due to privacy concerns, search results will only display the person user is looking for if user gets their name right to the T. User can also look for other Martians using their GSID.
